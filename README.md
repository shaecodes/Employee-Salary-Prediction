# Employee Salary Prediction EDA
This project is aimed at building a model to predict the salaries of employees based on various features such as experience years, age, gender, department, location, and travel requirements.

# Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

- ID: unique identifier for each employee
- Experience_Years: number of years of experience the employee has
- Age: age of the employee
- Gender: gender of the employee
- Salary: the salary of the employee
- Dept_name: the department the employee belongs to
- location: the location where the employee is based
- travel_required: whether the employee is required to travel as part of their job

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The first step in the data analysis process was to check for any missing values and outliers. The data was found to be relatively clean with no missing values. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed on the dataset to understand the relationships between the different features. This included visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.  

Some of the key findings from the EDA include:  

- The distribution of salary is right-skewed, with a large number of employees earning low salaries.
- Employees with more years of experience tend to earn higher salaries.
- The majority of employees are based in Bangalore, with a relatively small number based in Pune and Mumbai.
- There is a positive correlation between age and experience years, indicating that older employees tend to have more experience.
- The department with the highest salary is finance

# Conclusion
The EDA provided useful insights into the dataset, enabling us to better understand the relationships between the different features. These insights will be valuable in building an accurate model to predict employee salaries based on their characteristics.
